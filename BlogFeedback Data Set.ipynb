    "This data originates from blog posts. The raw HTML-documents of the blog posts were crawled and processed. In the train data, the basetimes were in the years 2010 and 2011. In the test data the basetimes were in February and March 2012.\n",

    "**The data set has 280 attributes. Therefore, in this notebooks we test different techniques to deal with this large number of attributes**. First, we analyze the whole data set without any kind of adjustment. This will be our reference model. Then, we test some feature selection methods to identify the most relevant attributes to predict the target value. Finally, we test the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction method.\n",

    "After preparing the data set, we are ready to select and train our ML model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a Linear Regression (LR) model. \"A regression model, such as linear regression, models an output value based on a linear combination of input values\" [(BROWNLEE, 2020)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/introduction-to-time-series-forecasting-with-python/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we try some regularized linear models. This kind of model constrain the weights of the model, avoiding overfitting (GÉRON, 2019). We try three regularized linear models [(BROWNLEE, 2016)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-with-python/):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ridge regression. This model model uses the L2 regularization. It adds “squared magnitude” of coefficient as a penalty term to the loss function [(NAGPAL, 2017)](https://towardsdatascience.com/l1-and-l2-regularization-methods-ce25e7fc831c).\n",
    "2. Lasso regression. This model model uses the L1 regularization. It adds “absolute value of magnitude” of coefficient as penalty term to the loss function (NAGPAL, 2017).\n",
    "3. Elastic Net. This model combines the Ridge and the Lasso models. \"It seeks to minimize the complexity of the regression model (magnitude and number of regression coefficients) by penalizing the model using both the L2-norm (sum squared coefficient values) and the L1-norm (sum absolute coefficient values)\" (BROWNLEE, 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we also try some nonlinear algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Classification and Regression Trees (CART). It uses \"the train- ing data to select the best points to split the data in order to minimize a cost metric\" (BROWNLEE, 2016).\n",
    "2. k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). This model \"locates the k most similar instances in the training dataset for a new data instance\" (BROWNLEE, 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "The models are evaluated using the mean absolute error (MAE), root square mean error (RMSE), and R². RMSE punish larger errors more than smaller errors, inflating or magnifying the mean error score. This is due to the square of the error value. MAE does not give more or less weight to different types of errors and instead the scores increase linearly with increases in error. MAE is the simplest evaluation metric and most easily interpreted. R² tells you how much variance your model accounts for. In the case of the MAE and RMSE, the lower the better. But for R², the close the value is to 1, the better ([HALE, 2020](https://towardsdatascience.com/which-evaluation-metric-should-you-use-in-machine-learning-regression-problems-20cdaef258e); [BROWNLEE, 2021](https://machinelearningmastery.com/regression-metrics-for-machine-learning/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, \"the key to a fair comparison of machine learning algorithms is ensuring that each algorithm is evaluated in the same way on the same data. You can achieve this by forcing each algorithm to be evaluated on a consistent test harness\" (BROWNLEE, 2016). In this project, we do this by using the same split in the cross validation. We use the KFold function from the sklearn library with a random value rs as the random_state parameter. Although the rs value change everytime the notebook is run, once it is set, the same rs value is used in all the models. This guarantees that all the models are evaluated on the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the tests of the models with the training data shows that **the KNN is the best model**. It has the lowest MAE and RMSE, and the highest R².\n",
    "\n",
    "However, differing scales of the raw data could be negatively impacting the performance of some of the models. Therefore, we test the models again, but this time we standardize the data set.\n",

    "\"Mutual information from the field of information theory is the application of information gain (typically used in the construction of decision trees) to feature selection. Mutual information is calculated between two variables and measures the reduction in uncertainty for one variable given a known value of the other variable\"  (BROWNLEE, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "We find that many attributes have negligible information value. 181 features have a contribution score over 0.0001, 144 over 0.001, 65 over 0.01, and only 33 over 0.1. **These numbers can vary depending on the training set**. Therefore, we will test the 30, 70, 150, and 190 best features and compare it with the results obtained using all features. \n",
    "\n",
    "**We see that the performance using the 70, 150, and 190 best features are almost the same of using all features. Using the 30 beast features is just slighlty worst than using all features**. Moreover, in all cases the KNN model have the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could do a grid search to \"systematically test a range of different numbers of selected features and discover which results in the best performing model\" (BROWNLEE, 2021). **However, a grid search to determine the optimum number of features would require a lot of computing time and the benefit would not be significant in our evaluation**."

This method searches \"for a subset of features by starting with all features in the training dataset and successfully removing features until the desired number remains. This is achieved by fitting the given machine learning algorithm used in the core of the model, ranking features by importance, discarding the least important features, and re-fitting the model\" (BROWNLEE, 2021).\n",

    "\"Dimensionality reduction refers to techniques that reduce the number of input variables in a dataset. Fewer input dimensions often mean correspondingly fewer parameters or a simpler structure in the machine learning model, referred to as degrees of freedom. A model with too many degrees of freedom is likely to overfit the training dataset and therefore may not perform well on new data\" (BROWNLEE, 2021).\n",

    "There are several techniques to reduce a data set dimensionality. **In this notebook, we use the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is the most used method for dimensionality reduction**. \"It can be thought of as a projection method where data with m-columns (features) is projected into a subspace with m or fewer columns, whilst retaining the essence of the original data\" (BROWNLEE, 2021). \n",

Besides, once more the KNN model is better than the other models tested."

    "1. Mutual Information Statistics\n",
    "2. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)\n",
    "3. Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "The features selected by the RFE were the ones that resulted in the best performance of the KNN model.\n",

    "Finaly, we also used a dimensionality reduction method, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the size of our data set. Our results with the train set showed that both the RFE and the PCA, combined with the KNN model, had similar results.\n",

    "**Therefore, we tested two models with our test set: (i) KNN + RFE and (ii) KNN + PCA. We verified that the models performed our identically**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, our models performed modestly at best. All evaluation metrics used are poor**, especially the RMSE and the R². The fact that the RMSE is much higher than the suggests that our data has many outliers and, consequently, our model is making some big errors. **Nonetheless, given that these are quite simple regression methods, we could consider that the results are reasonable**. More complex models could be used to achieve better predictions. However, these models would probably demand more time to build and more computing power to run, which could actually mean a worse cost-benefit."
